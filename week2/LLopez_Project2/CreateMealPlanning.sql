/* This SQL script creates a new database, the MealPlanning database, and inserts some data into the database.
	This will be another example database we will be using in this course. */

-- First, lets add a database to work with, and let's use the MealPlanning set of relations. We can do this with the UI, using the "Add Schema" button, or we can write the SQL

-- Its good practice to check if the database exists before adding it, especially in a database script like this one. That way, you can run it multiple times!
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS MealPlanning;

-- Create the database MealPlanning. Note this is the SQL Create Statement that is written for you when you use the UI to create a new schema
-- Also note that create schema is synonomous to create database in MySql. 
-- This is not true in Sql Server. It is a decision that the database engine creators decided to make.
CREATE DATABASE MealPlanning;

-- Because we are using a script, and because a script let's us execute against different databases, even in the same script, we have to tell it what database we want to use. If we want to use a different 
-- database later on, we would use another "Use" statement to indicate that. But we are going to stick to the Meal Planning Database.
USE  MealPlanning;

-- Now, we need to create the tables, which are how SQL internally stores a relation, and all the information about that relation. Notice that these create table SQL statements are very
-- similiar to our relation's schemas. Again, its a good practice to check if a table exists before creating it. We can drop tables if they currently exist. I'll show both ways in this script. The rest of the table definition should be familiar.
-- We see out relation/table name, its attributes in a comma seperated list, the domains of each attribute, and we define a primary key
--  The domain has more information then we've seen before: it talks about if an attribute can be null.

-- When I went to create the Cookbook relation, I noticed that our attribute Cookbook.Name was a poor choice, as Name is a MySql keyword.
-- Its good practice to not use keywords as attribute or table names. Also not that we are paying attention not only to our attribute domains, but if we allow nulls.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Cookbook (
CookbookName varchar(200)  not null,
IsBook bool not null,
Website varchar(200),
PRIMARY KEY ( CookbookName)
);

-- Let's see how we'd drop a table if its exists. I'll have to create it again, but since I know it doesn't exist at that point in the script, no need to check for existance before creating it. 
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Cookbook;

CREATE TABLE Cookbook (
CookbookName varchar(200)  not null,
IsBook bool not null,
Website varchar(200),
PRIMARY KEY ( CookbookName)
);

-- We can also just drop the table althogther, because we know it exists. It would return an error if this was not true! And we'll have to create it one more time.
DROP TABLE Cookbook;

CREATE TABLE Cookbook (
CookbookName varchar(200)  not null,
IsBook bool not null,
Website varchar(200),
PRIMARY KEY ( CookbookName)
);

-- When i created the Recipe relation as a table, again I decided to rename some of my attrbutes. Name and Source are MySql keywords we want to avoid.
-- I also know that Cookbook.Name is referenced by Recipe.CookbookName, so let's make sure the domains/IngredientTypes match!
-- Also not that any attributes identified as a primary key or a foreign key when we designed the relations is not null! 
-- We haven't added any SQL to define those constraints, but when we do, these attributes/column must be not null!
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Recipe (
RecipeName varchar(100) not null,
CookbookName varchar (200) not null,
TotalServings int,
PRIMARY KEY (RecipeName),
FOREIGN KEY (CookbookName) REFERENCES Cookbook (CookbookName) on update cascade on delete cascade
);

-- We had to rename some columns again, Name and IngredientType are SQL Keywords and we want to avoid that!
-- Also note the keyword auto_increment. This means that when we insert into the table, we dont have to give a value for Id, the database engine
-- will just do that for us, and our Ids will be in numerical order. This is a good practice for ensuring the values of a primary key column are unique. 
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Ingredients (
Id int not null auto_increment,
IngredientName varchar(100) not null,
IngredientType varchar (100),
PRIMARY KEY (Id)
);

-- Two things of note here. I made sure that RecipeName had the same domain/IngredientType as Recipe.RecipeName, and our primary key can have multiple attrbutes, just like in relation algrebra
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Meal (
RecipeName varchar(100) not null,
IngredientId int not null,
PRIMARY KEY (RecipeName, IngredientId),
FOREIGN KEY (RecipeName) REFERENCES Recipe (RecipeName) on update cascade on delete cascade,
FOREIGN KEY (IngredientId) REFERENCES Ingredients (Id) on update cascade on delete cascade
);

-- In order to query these tables, they need some data in them!

-- For our nullable columns, meaning the attributes whose domains allow nulls, we don't even need them in the insert staement, unless they have a value. The null is added for us by the database engine

-- Because I am entering this data from our practive problem relation, I know the IngredientIds. If I didn't have those tables to work from, I'd just do a select on the Ingredient table, so I could
-- see the values addded by the database engine.
-- How would I do a select? Its the same concept as in relation alegrba, we use an operation on the relation to generate a relation instance. But the syntax is better for programmers to work with. Let's add one into the script! 
-- You can always highlight part of the script, and execute just that part, clicking the lighting bolt button.
SELECT * FROM Ingredients;

INSERT INTO Meal (RecipeName, IngredientId) VALUES ("Fajitas", 1);

-- At this point, let's end with select statements, so we can see the current relation instances of all our four relations/tables:
-- Note that you will see the ingredient table twice, because we did a select earlier. You should get a tab opening for each table instance that looks similiar to the grids we've seen in class
